* Upload it to pip! Installation and usage should be as simple as:
```bash
pip install python-lib-ale
# Use the submodule 'ale_to_csv'
python -m libale ale_to_csv samples/A001.ale
```

* Make this a module

* Gather a whole heap of real world ALEs to iron out any major things that I'm missing

* Implement pytesting
